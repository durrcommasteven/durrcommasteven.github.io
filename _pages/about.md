title: "Hi! I'm Steve"
---

I have a doctorate in theoretical physics from UCLA, and a BA from Cornell in physics and math. I've also spent summers
as a SWE intern Google; one at Google my Business, and one trying to make certain experiments work at Google Quantum AI.

Here's my [resume](https://github.com/durrcommasteven/steves_site/assets/images/resume_22.pdf).

I have a lot of miscellaneous questions that pop into my head, and like to work things out from first principles. This
often results in [random projects](/posts/).
