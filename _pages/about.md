I have a PhD in theoretical physics from UCLA, and a BA from Cornell in physics and math. I've also spent summers
as a SWE intern Google; one at Google my Business, and one trying to make certain experiments work at Google Quantum AI.

Here's my [resume]({% link /assets/pdfs/resume_2022.pdf %}).

I have a lot of miscellaneous questions that pop into my head, and like to work things out from first principles. This
often results in [random projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts).
