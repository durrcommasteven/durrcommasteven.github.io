title: "Hi! I'm Steve"

I'm currently a Senior Scientist at STR, where I apply machine learning, statistics, and physics to national security challenges.

I have a PhD in theoretical physics from UCLA, and a BA from Cornell double majoring in physics and math. 
I've also spent summers as a SWE intern Google; one at Google my Business, and one trying to make certain experiments work at Google Quantum AI.

Here's my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdfs/Steven_Durr_Resume.pdf %}).

I have a lot of miscellaneous questions that pop into my head, and like to work things out from first principles. This
often results in [random projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts).

And here's the graduate student address I gave at UCLA's physics commencement ceremony
